## Problem

You are given a table, <em>BST</em>, containing two columns: <em>N&nbsp;</em>and <em>P,</em>&nbsp;where <em>N</em> represents the value of a node in <em>Binary Tree</em>, and <em>P</em> is the parent of <em>N</em>.

Write a query to find the node type of <em>Binary Tree</em> ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

<ul>
	<li><em>Root</em>: If node is root node.</li>
	<li><em>Leaf</em>: If node is leaf node.</li>
	<li><em>Inner</em>: If node is neither root nor leaf node.</li>
</ul>

    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Professor' THEN Name END) AS Professor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Singer' THEN Name END) AS Singer,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Actor' THEN Name END) AS Actor
FROM (
    SELECT
        Name,
        Occupation,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY Occupation
            ORDER BY Name
        ) AS rn
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
) AS t
GROUP BY rn
ORDER BY rn;
