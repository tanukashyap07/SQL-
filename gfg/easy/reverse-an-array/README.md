# Reverse Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers  **arr[]**. You have to reverse the given array.

 **Note:** Modify the array in place.

**Examples:
**

```
Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].
```

```
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].

```

```
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseArray(int arr[]) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;

            
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
