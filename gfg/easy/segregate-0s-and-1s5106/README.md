# Segregate 0s and 1s

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  consisting of only  **0** 's and  **1** 's. Modify the array  **in-place**  to segregate 0s onto the left side and 1s onto the right side of the array.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Explanation:  After segregation, all the 0's are on the left and 1's are on the right. Modified array will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1]
Output: [1, 1]
Explanation: There are no 0s in the given array, so the modified array is [1, 1]
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void segregate0and1(int[] arr) {

        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {

            while (arr[left] == 0 && left < right) {
                left++;
            }

            while (arr[right] == 1 && left < right) {
                right--;
            }

            if (left < right) {
                int temp = arr[left];
                arr[left] = arr[right];
                arr[right] = temp;

                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
